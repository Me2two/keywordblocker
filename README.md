# Keyword Blocker
## Block Youtube Videos based on specified keywords

This Chrome extension can block youtube videos from view based on keywords you can set.
It features a very basic password protection and the block message is user-customizable.

Originally this was developed for a person who is easily scared and needed to be protected from certain youtube searches. Because there was no easy way to do this I developed this application.

It is made for this person but published as an extension to possibly help other people who may have the same needs!


**Changelog:**
   - **1.6**
    * Added csv export
   - **1.5** 
    * Added option to also search the description for blocked keywords
   - **1.4**
    * Redesign for a more robust extension (hopefully this will break less often now)
    * Added an option to remove unwanted video's from search results/frontpage instead of always showing the block pop-over
