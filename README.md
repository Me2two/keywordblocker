# Keyword Blocker
## Block Youtube Videos based on specified keywords

This Chrome extension can block YouTube videos or channels from view based on keywords you can specify.
It features a very basic password protection and the block message is user-customizable.

Originally this was developed for a person who is easily scared and needed to be protected from certain YouTube searches. Because there was no easy way to do this I developed this extension.

Get it in the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keyword-blocker/pbgacppomjfpheddhifkdkklddnolnpg)
