# Keyword Blocker
## Block Youtube Videos based on specified keywords

This Chrome extension can block youtube videos from view based on keywords you can set.
It features a very basic password protection and the block message is user-customizable.

Originally this was developed for a person who is easily scared and needed to be protected from certain youtube searches. Because there was no easy way to do this I developed this application.

It is made for this person but published as an extension to possibly help other people who may have the same needs!

Get it in the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keyword-blocker/pbgacppomjfpheddhifkdkklddnolnpg)
